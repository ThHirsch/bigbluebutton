For Installing bigbluebutton with html5 client follow the following steps	
	
1.Run apt-get update
	#sudo apt-get update
2.Make repo known to apt
 	#sudo echo "deb http://repo.company-group.com/bigbluebutton.org/1-0 jessie main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list$
3.Install gpg key
	#sudo curl http://repo.company-group.com/bigbluebutton.org/1-0/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
4.Run apt-get update 
	#sudo apt-get update
5.Install bbb1.0
 	#sudo apt-get install bigbluebutton
6.Run dist-upgrade
	#sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
7.Install demo application to create meetings in various ways(ex. Html5 client, flash client with password & without password, with different roles, with dynamic config xml etc…).
	#sudo apt-get install bbd-demo
8.Install bbb-chek application to check weather all the components are up and running properly if not it will show errors and suggestions.
 	#sudo apt-get bbd-check
9.To enable WebRTC audio
	#sudo bbb-conf --enablewebrtc
10.Run apt-get update
	#sudo apt-get update
11.Install bbb-html5
	#sudo apt-get install bbb-html5
12.Change the user of /usr/share/meteor to the current user. Earlier current user did not have permission of this folder so we were facing "SQLITE_CANTOPEN: unable to open database file" error while 	    executing start.sh.So this problem has been solved by following command.
	#sudo chown -R $USER /usr/share/meteor 
			
13.Move to /usr/share/meteor/html5/app directory because you can not execute start.sh from any other directory so you first need to go to /usr/share/meteor/html5/app directory to execute it.
	cd /usr/share/meteor/html5/app
		
14.Start meteor.Please not that never run following command as root user.Executing it with sudo breaks permissions.
	#./start.sh

15.Complete restart bigbluebutton	
	#sudo bbb-conf --clean
